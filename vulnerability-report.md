###Vulnerability: Auth Information in Repo

I was able to find the database name and password in old versions of the software.  I also found old login information in the tests.  I tried to log in with both but was not able to get it.

####Repair Suggestion
Don't commit/push passwords in the first place.  If it happens, change your passwords, and maybe delete those commits.


###Attempted Exploitation

####XSS
I tried to write code in to the login field to fool the credential check.  It did not work.  In the terminal session image below you can see some of my attempts, as seen in pdb.

####Broken Auth
There is not a place to register on the site, so I wasn't able to try to fool the authorization

####Insecure DOR
I attempted all of the routes maually, but all were protected with permissions.  If I attempted to access the delete or add views, I was greeted with a 403.
